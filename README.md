A 14-day A/B test analyzing organic search indexing latency across 20+ U.S. markets using Schema markup.

# SEO Growth Loop: Indexing Velocity Experiment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between **Structured Data (Schema.org)** and **Organic Search Indexing Velocity**. 

The goal was to solve the "Cold Start" problem for user-generated content: **How quickly can we get a new page indexed by search engines across different U.S. geographies?**

## 🧪 Methodology
* **Hypothesis:** Implementing specific JSON-LD schema markup will reduce indexing latency from >30 days to <14 days.
* **Test Duration:** 14 Days (Holiday Period).
* **Sample Size:** 20+ Distinct U.S. Markets (Coast-to-Coast coverage).
* **Variable:** Optimized Schema vs. Unoptimized Baseline.

## 📊 Key Findings
* **Velocity:** Achieved indexing in **20+ states** (including Alaska and Hawaii) within the 14-day window.
* **Coverage:** Validated "Coast-to-Coast" organic reach.
* **Impact:** Identified a scalable growth loop to accelerate user acquisition for new content pages.
